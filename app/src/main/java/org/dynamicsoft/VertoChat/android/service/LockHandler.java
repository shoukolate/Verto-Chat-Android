/**
 * Acquires and releases the wake lock, the wifi lock and the multicast lock when appropriate.

 * <p>The wake lock is optional, and helps avoid timeouts because the cpu goes to sleep,
 * and thus can't process packets from the network.</p>
 *
 * <p>The wifi lock can help with packet loss on some devices.</p>
 *
 * <p>The multicast lock is needed to process multicast packets on some devices.
 * The <code>Asus Transformer TF101</code> does not care, but the <code>HTC One</code> does not send
 * or receive any multicast packets without a lock.</p>
 *
 * <p>It's important to keep the locks as fields, and not just as variables, since
 * garbage collected locks are automatically released.</p>

/**
 * Link movement method with support for text selection as well, on Android 3.0 or newer.
 *
 * <p>Usually you have to choose between {@link LinkMovementMethod} to get link support,
 * or {@link android.text.method.ArrowKeyMovementMethod} to get selection support.</p>
 *
 * <p>Or you could set the autoLink property on the {@link android.widget.TextView}.
 * But it seems to be a bit buggy. It's looks like it's random which url you get to when you click on a link.
 * And it doesn't work on Android 2.3.3, at least not in the emulator.</p>
 *
 * <p>The selection support is disabled on Android 2.3.3, because it doesn't work. Trying to select using a regular
 * {@link android.text.method.ArrowKeyMovementMethod} gives a popup to select, but it's not possible to
 * actually select anything. Trying to select using this class only leads to:
 * <code>java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException: setSpan (-1 ... -1) starts before 0</code></p>

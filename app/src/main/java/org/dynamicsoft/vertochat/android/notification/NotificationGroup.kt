/**
 * Notification groups are used on Android N and newer to avoid automatic
 * grouping of all notifications together with the low priority service notification.
 *
 * <p>For some reason, only notifications without a group are automatically grouped by Android.
 * Notifications with a group are not grouped, unless a summary notification is used,
 * which I'd like to avoid because of complexity.</p>
 *
 * <p>Another reason to only use groups on Android N and newer is that older versions
 * won't show grouped notifications at all without a summary notification.</p>
 *
 * <p>Since private chat notifications are the only notifications that are useful to
 * group automatically, they are the only ones to not have a group. Also, automatic grouping
 * doesn't happen until 4 or more ungrouped notifications are shown.</p>

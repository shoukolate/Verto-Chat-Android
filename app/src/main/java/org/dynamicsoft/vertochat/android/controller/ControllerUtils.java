     * Removes spans with references to the text view.
     * <p>
     * <p>There are several spans that are added to the text here and there, like:</p>
     * <p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>android.text.DynamicLayout$ChangeWatcher</li>
     * <li>android.widget.TextView$ChangeWatcher</li>
     * <li>android.widget.Editor$EasyEditSpanController</li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * <p>These spans are of type {@link NoCopySpan}, and are not important to the text or how it's shown.
     * Since they are inner classes, they keep a reference to their parent, like a {@link TextView}.
     * And that references a context, which is usually an activity.</p>
     * <p>
     * <p>If the text was garbage collected, then this would still not be a problem, but often it's not.
     * The reason is that some of these lines are cached by the TextLine class, including all the spans.
     * So to give the text view and the activity a chance to be garbage collected, then these spans must be
     * removed.</p>
     *
     * @param textView The text view with the text to remove references from.
